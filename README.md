# odin-recipes
In this project I am building a basic recipe website using everything I learned about HTML and CSS in The Odin Project.

Once I complete this project, I will demonstrate basic HTML skills like creating a boilerplate, adding titles, paragraphs, lists, and images, as well as create links to other webpages, and adding italics and bold text.
